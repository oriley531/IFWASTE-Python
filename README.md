## Assumptions

- Every meal is with whole house
- Food has no inedible parts
- Data on kcal taken taken and interpreted from FNDDS data through (Drewnowski, 2010)\

## Structure

- Food has servings, kcal/g, price/g, g/serving
- Food is only eaten as is from store
- shopping picks food from a store with food items inside
(want to change to a data table of food and attributes possibly from actual store data)
- output is a dataset of House, type, amount, day
- no line graph though
